Code is under GPLv3.  In addition, private single-person use need not
be made publicly available (as GPLv3), but any public use
(e.g. publications) requires that any new code be publicly and freely
available (e.g. at github) under the same license terms.  This is
maximally open-source and copyleft.

========================
Requirements
========================

1) Linux (e.g. like Ubuntu, what's on NASA Pleides, TACC Stampede, etc.)

2) MPI (for mpicc and mpirun)

If have no MPI, then change USEMPI to 0 in makehead.inc.
If have no OpenMP, then change USEOPENMP to 0 in makehead.inc

For no MPI or OpenMP, then change scripts/fulltest.sh command to
mkdir run ; cd run ; cp ../grmhd . ; ./grmhd 1 1 1

For no MPI, then change scripts/fulltest.sh command to
mkdir run ; cd run ; cp ../grmhd . ; ./grmhd 1 1 1 1

3) Intel MKL (for lapack related library)

If have no Intel MKL, then change USELAPACK and USELAPACKNEW to 0 in makehead.inc.

4) For the analysis stage, many python 2.7 related packages (see
docs/general_plotting_guide.txt for details, but all standard packages
one can easily install on Ubuntu).  Python packages used include:
python, python2.7-setuptools, python-dateutil, yasm, ipython,
python-nose, python2.7-scipy, python2.7-numpy, python-matplotlib,
python-matplotlib-data, dvipng .  Try installing these, then if below
"fulltest.sh" doesn't work, then send me your output and we can figure
out what packages you are missing.

========================
Basic Instructions (assuming MPI, OpenMP, and MKL taken care of as above):
========================

git clone git@github.com:pseudotensor/harm_harmgit.git
cd harm_harmgit
git branch master
# for single node 16-task MPI test from setting up run through analysis
sh scripts/fulltest.sh
